### Architectures

> Rebecca Parsons - CTO ThoughtWorks.
 
Her Keynote (1st day) and her talk in the afternoon about "Evolutionary Architecture" were really nice. Near my desk I have a print of [The Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar), an amazing screenshot of technologies from ThoughtWorks. I couldn't resist to take a picture with her!

### Motivational

> Linda Rising

Her Keynote (2nd day) about "Myths and Patterns of Organizational Change" was very inspiring for me, at the and of the talk there was a long applause for Linda, she really deserved it. She suggested some books to read, in particular I was interested in [Thinking, Fast and Slow - US version](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1458504391&sr=8-1&keywords=thinking+fast+and+slow). I just bought the Italian Version [Pensieri, Lenti e Veloci](http://www.amazon.it/Pensieri-lenti-veloci-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/8804627921/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1458504337&sr=1-1&keywords=thinking+fast+and+slow)

Here are some slides from the speech
