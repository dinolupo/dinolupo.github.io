Today is the linux day in Italy. I downloaded [ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) distro and I installed it in a vmware workstation. My impressions are positive: i like the live installer cd, you can choose to use it as a live distro or install to your hd to release its full potential.<!--more-->

One important thing was the choose to lock the root account, so the install process was simpler and you cannot neither login as root or use the **su** command to run superuser commands. You have to use [sudo](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo) for commands that require root privileges. 

The distro come with openoffice.org, graphics, instant messaging and many other programs. I think government institutions, schools and also small businesses can give it a try. 

I also installed netbeans, eclipse and jdk of course, all it's very fast, I like it!

See you next time!
