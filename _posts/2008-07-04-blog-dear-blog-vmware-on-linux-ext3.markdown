It's been a long time since I updated this blog....   
  
Here is a tip to work with vmware on linux ext3 filesystem.  
You have to add this line in your .vmx file:  
  
**mainMem.useNamedFile=FALSE**Â    
  
put that at the end or anywhere you like.  
  
I tried to use Ubuntu 64 and VMware 64 bit to run a windows 2003 server (32 bit) and I did of course the 32-bit library installation in order to work with 32 bit operating systems.  
  
Bye,
