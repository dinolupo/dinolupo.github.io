I tried many open source editors for the web. My choice is  
[FCKEditor](http://www.fckeditor.net/). I like its capability to hide the toolbar, it's multilanguge (i tried arabic version at work and right-to-left, all is ok), it's multi-browser support and it'is very stable.  
  
Give it a try.  
Have a good year.
